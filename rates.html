"We stayed with Joy &amp; Martin over the weekend of our wedding. On the first night it was myself and my five bridesmaids. The next day we got dressed and ready to go at their home, and then myself and my husband spent our wedding night there. Joy and Martin went over and above what was expected of them as B&amp;B hosts to make us comfortable, welcome, and the weekend was that much more special for their thoughtful hospitality.

<p>On the first night the girls and I came back from the rehearsal dinner to find the lounge laid out with glasses and chocolates to go with the bubbles I had brought in. The breakfast in the morning was plentiful and varied, with Joy and Martin on standby providing scrambled eggs and coffee. As we got ready (hair, make-up) our hosts stuck around making sure that we had everything we needed, more coffee as the morning progressed, plates etc. when lunch arrived. Joy even took some extra photos of us as we got ready which she has emailed to me. On the wedding night we arrived to find Joy and Martin decided to completely vacate the property to give myself and new hubby privacy.  We arrived to find a tray, set with wine, chocolates, in the kitchen for us to enjoy. The next morning the breakfast was again wonderful and Joy &amp; Martin are such lovely friendly people it was lovely to have a chat to them during breakfast and tell them about how it all went.

<p>
The house was always spotless.

<p>
All in all, I don't think I could have picked a better place to stay for our wedding weekend. Joy and Martin treated us like family and I am extremely grateful to them for their thoughtful and generous hospitality. Thanks so much guys!"</em></p>
