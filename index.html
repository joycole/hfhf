	<p>Meeting and getting to know a wide range of people from various countries is a passion of ours.  Our previous Home Stay in Wellington, New Zealand was a delight to run. After five years we moved to Bribie Island in November 2015 and our new home has been built and designed with our guests in mind.  We met so many wonderful people during our time hosting in Wellington and look forward to the opportunity to ensure your visit to our new home in Bribie is perfect. Whether that be enjoying a refreshing appertif together or letting you unwind in privacy is up to you.
