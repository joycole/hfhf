Guests' Comments:

<p>
<em> "We were slow to rise on our first morning, and came into the dining area to find a continental breakfast laid out that's worthy of a 5 stay hotel. Cereals, cold meats, fruit, vegetables, eggs, toast, condiments, juice and fresh coffee. Something I'd normally pay a lot for at a hotel was included and our hosts took pride and pleasure in doing so. We were even asked how we wanted our eggs and given the option of Gluten Free bread (great for me as I'm Coeliac)." </em> </p>

"The breakfast was the best of the whole journey!" </em>
